1. A Node module is similar to a React component, but is intended for use with back-end/server-side coding operations.
These modules are blocks of code that can be exported and imported into other JS files and they are comprised of various methods
that can be reused across a server application.

2. The primary distinction between module.exports and exports is that module.exports refers to the entire module object.
Therefore, if methods are saved to the module.exports object and then the object is reassigned later to a different value(s), an error
will occur because the exported methods will no longer be retrievable. Using exports, on the other hand, prevents this from happening because
it is not the module.exports object, but is simply a reference to it that is used to add methods to the object.

3. Exports is recommended over module.exports in all instances where you do not need the module.exports object to be of a specific type because
it prevents the scenario described in answer number two.
