1. Essentially, client-side code serves to build or render information presented by the server in the form of JS logic and html. The main purpose of client-side code
is to present the user with a GUI that incorporates desired information from a database or server. Client-side code creates HTTP requests which are sent to the server
which gathers and responds to these requests with the appropriate data. Therefore, server-side code is intended to act as a middle-man between the user and the database
and responds to user requests by locating and outputing data based on user interactions. Client-side code is considered the front-end whereas server-side code is the back-end.

2. Probably the most notable cause for Node's popularity is its implementation of isomorphic JS programming, which basically means that JS is the language used for both
the front-end and back-end services. Many other back-end frameworks require the coder to learn a separate language, but Node enables the use of JS for both client-side and
server-side purposes. Furthermore, Node is noticeably faster than comparative frameworks, likely because it is build using Google Chrome's powerful V8 JS engine.
Many large companies and institutions such as eBay, LinkedIn, PayPal, NASA, Uber, and Walmart use Node, primarily because of its ability to provide reliable and fast server-side
access in an asynchronous manner for a large multitude of users at a single time. For instance, Node's website recognizes Walmart's need to maintain a viable site for the millions
of shoppers that flood the website during the holidays and especially during Black Friday.
